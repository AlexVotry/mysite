I was born on a marine base in Cherry Point North Carolina. We moved several times until second grade when we made our home in Oak Harbor, Washington. In 7th grade my dad bought a TRS80 home computer from Radio Shack. I learned a little Basic programming, enough to move some sprites around and shoot each other.

<!-- I moved to Seattle to go to the University of Washington. I couldn't decide what I wanted to do, and took classes in every subject I could think of. I finished with a BA in psychology and still no plans.

I bought a one-way ticket to Japan and found a job coaching international corporations in American culture and language.

After 3 years I came back and went back to UW to complete my third year of Japanese. During this time I met the love of my life and convinced her to marry me. From there, I learned a trade, became a master plumber and started my own business, which I ran for over 15 years.

During the last 5 years I found I wasn't enjoying what I was doing. I spent time exploring what I enjoy doing, and found programing was what I enjoyed doing most. I would write dynamic spread sheets to figure out various data. I finished a couple on line courses in Excell, but I wanted to do more. -->
